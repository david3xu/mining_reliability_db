### **4. Investigation Approach Effectiveness**

#### **Historical Intelligence Recommended:**
- "Perform teardown analysis of failed motor components"
- "Trace contamination path using oil analysis and filter inspection"
- "Review maintenance logs and sampling history for early warning signs"
- "Update service sheets to include contamination inspection"

#### **Gold Standard Actual Process:**
```
"Comments": "Procedure received from Tynan Wells | Job planned in to remove rear slew motor on 01/08/2023 | In the specialist meeting it was agreed that a work study of checking each sensor plug needs to be done"
```

#### **Process Accuracy Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ **Teardown Analysis**: Predicted component analysis ‚úì | Actually motor removal for inspection ‚úì | **PERFECT MATCH**
- ‚úÖ **Systematic Investigation**: Predicted thorough analysis ‚úì | Actually work study and specialist meetings ‚úì | **EXCELLENT MATCH**
- ‚úÖ **Expert Consultation**: Implied technical consultation ‚úì | Actually Tynan Wells involvement ‚úì | **GOOD MATCH**
- ‚úÖ **Procedure Focus**: Predicted service sheet updates ‚úì | Actually procedure development ‚úì | **EXCELLENT MATCH**

**Investigation Approach Score: 9/10** (Nearly perfect alignment with actual investigation methods)
