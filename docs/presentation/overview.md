## High-Level Project Understanding

This is a **graph-based operational intelligence system** for mining reliability analysis, built around incident workflow tracking rather than traditional maintenance management.

### Core Business Logic

The system models **incident progression through operational stages**:

- Incident reporting → Problem definition → Root cause analysis → Action planning → Effectiveness verification
- Each stage represents a critical workflow entity with completion tracking and causal intelligence

### Architectural Foundation

**Three-tier separation pattern**: Core business logic → Data adapters → UI components

- **mine_core**: Pure business intelligence and graph operations
- **dashboard.adapters**: Clean data access layer without business logic
- **dashboard.components**: UI rendering with single responsibilities

### Schema-Driven Intelligence

**Everything driven by configuration**:

- `field_mappings.json` drives data processing logic
- `model_schema.json` defines entity relationships and UI generation
- `workflow_stages_config.json` defines business process flow
- Zero hardcoding - all interfaces dynamically generated

### Data Intelligence Model

**Graph relationships capture operational patterns**:

- Facilities contain action requests
- Problems emerge from action requests
- Root causes analyze problems
- Action plans resolve root causes
- Verifications validate action plans

### Navigation Architecture

**Hub-based exploration pattern**:

- Clean metric cards home page for overview
- Dedicated analysis pages for deep-dive investigation
- Facility-specific drill-down with routing
- Professional URL patterns for bookmark-able analysis

### Technical Intelligence

**Neo4j graph database** captures:

- Causal relationship patterns between incidents
- Workflow completion intelligence across facilities
- Temporal analysis of operational effectiveness
- Field-level data quality assessment

The system transforms raw mining operational data into **actionable reliability intelligence** through workflow completion analysis, causal pattern recognition, and facility performance comparison.

## Fundamental Mismatch Analysis

**The project does NOT match your manager's request.**

### Manager's Actual Need

**Basic data quality assessment**:

- Missing value counts per column
- Incorrect value identification
- Simple statistical summaries
- Four facility-specific analyses
- PowerPoint deliverable format

### Current Project Reality

**Advanced operational intelligence system**:

- Graph-based causal analysis
- Interactive dashboard architecture
- Workflow completion tracking
- Schema-driven dynamic interfaces

## Core Problem

**Over-engineering for a fundamental data exploration task.**

Your manager requested a **data quality audit** - essentially Excel-level statistical analysis with clear stakeholder questions. The current system delivers **enterprise operational intelligence** - sophisticated graph analytics for ongoing reliability management.

## Alignment Assessment

**Completely misaligned deliverable focus**:

- **Requested**: Static analysis → PowerPoint → Stakeholder questions
- **Built**: Dynamic dashboard → Interactive exploration → Complex workflows

**Timeline reality**:

- **Needed**: Quick statistical summary by 27-May
- **Current**: Production-ready intelligence platform requiring extensive setup

## Fundamental Solution Direction

**Strip to essential data quality analysis**:

1. Direct column-by-column statistical assessment
2. Missing value percentage calculations
3. Data type validation checks
4. Facility-specific quality scorecards
5. Clear stakeholder question formulation

The sophisticated Neo4j architecture and dashboard components are **irrelevant** for this basic data quality requirement. Your manager needs **fundamental data exploration**, not **operational intelligence infrastructure**.
