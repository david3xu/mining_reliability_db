# Stakeholder Essential Questions
## Mining Reliability Dashboard - Core Intelligence Framework

### Executive Summary

The mining reliability dashboard addresses four fundamental stakeholder concerns during incident response. Each question extracts specific intelligence from historical data to support immediate decision-making.

## The Four Essential Questions

### 1. "Can this be fixed?"
**Purpose:** Establish feasibility and precedent  
**Data Source:** Historical ActionPlan and Verification records  
**Intelligence Extracted:**
- Proven solution precedents for similar incidents
- Success rates of implemented solutions
- Verification of solution effectiveness

**Query Logic:**
```cypher
MATCH (ap:ActionPlan)<-[:VALIDATES]-(v:Verification)
MATCH (ap)-[:RESOLVES]->(rc:RootCause)-[:ANALYZES]->(p:Problem)
WHERE keyword_match_conditions
RETURN ap.action_plan, v.is_action_plan_effective, facility_context
```

**Stakeholder Value:** Immediate confidence in resolution capability

---

### 2. "Who do I call?"
**Purpose:** Identify appropriate expertise and resources  
**Data Source:** ActionRequest initiating departments and categories  
**Intelligence Extracted:**
- Department expertise mapping by incident type
- Historical responsibility patterns
- Contact routing for specific equipment categories

**Query Logic:**
```cypher
MATCH (ar:ActionRequest)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(f:Facility)
WHERE equipment_category_filters
RETURN ar.initiating_department, ar.categories, case_frequency
```

**Stakeholder Value:** Direct routing to appropriate expertise

---

### 3. "How long will this take?"
**Purpose:** Timeline estimation based on historical patterns  
**Data Source:** Incident initiation to verification completion durations  
**Intelligence Extracted:**
- Average resolution timelines by action type
- Complexity indicators affecting duration
- Sample size confidence for estimates

**Query Logic:**
```cypher
MATCH path: (ar:ActionRequest)-[*]->(v:Verification)
WHERE action_similarity_conditions
CALCULATE duration.between(ar.initiation_date, v.verification_date)
RETURN avg_duration, complexity_classification, sample_size
```

**Stakeholder Value:** Resource planning and expectation management

---

### 4. "What works and why?"
**Purpose:** Evidence-based action recommendation  
**Data Source:** Effective ActionPlan records with rationale  
**Intelligence Extracted:**
- Proven effective actions for similar problems
- Effectiveness rationale from verification comments
- Usage frequency indicating reliability

**Query Logic:**
```cypher
MATCH (ap:ActionPlan)<-[:VALIDATES]-(v:Verification)
WHERE v.is_action_plan_effective = "Yes" AND similarity_filters
RETURN ap.action_plan, v.action_plan_eval_comment, usage_frequency
```

**Stakeholder Value:** Evidence-based solution selection

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Incident Keywords → Neo4j Query Execution → Historical Pattern Analysis → Stakeholder-Specific Intelligence
```

### Core Components
- **Query Engine:** Direct Cypher execution against graph database
- **Pattern Matching:** Keyword-based similarity identification
- **Result Formatting:** Stakeholder-appropriate data presentation
- **Interface Logic:** Tab-based question navigation

### Technical Foundation
- **Database:** Neo4j graph relationships preserve incident context
- **Query Optimization:** Indexed properties for performance
- **Result Limitation:** 10 records per query for focused analysis
- **Confidence Indicators:** Usage frequency and sample size metrics
