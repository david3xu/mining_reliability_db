# Raw Data Dimensional Analysis for Ground Truth Questions

## Based on 45 Fields from Actual Mining Reliability Data

You're absolutely right! I jumped to theoretical solutions without analyzing the actual raw data. Let me systematically analyze what dimensions are **actually available** from the 45 fields.

## Raw Data Reality Check

### Field Structure Analysis

From `sample_5_fab16f86-faa9-44d9-b9d7-cfbbb47061da.json`:

**Total Fields**: 45 (not 41 as originally thought)

**Field Type Breakdown**:

```
Action Request Number: str    â†’ Unique identifier
Title: str                   â†’ Equipment problem description (TEXT analysis needed)
Initiation Date: str         â†’ Temporal dimension (clean categorical)
Action Types: str            â†’ Workflow type (categorical)
Categories: str              â†’ Equipment category (categorical)
Requested Response Time: int â†’ Urgency dimension (numerical)
Past Due Status: str         â†’ Status dimension (categorical)
Days Past Due: NoneType      â†’ Duration analysis (often null)
Operating Centre: str        â†’ Facility dimension (categorical)
Stage: str                   â†’ Workflow stage (categorical)
```

## Dimension Classification by Analysis Complexity

### ðŸŽ¯ Raw Data Strategy for Copilot Studio Integration

Based on practical implementation experience, here's how to map raw data dimensions to **business value categories** for Copilot Studio:

```bash
RAW_DATA_CATEGORIES = {
  "incident_identification": ["Action Request Number", "Title", "Initiation Date", "Operating Centre"],
  "problem_description": ["Title", "What happened?", "Categories"],
  "solution_tracking": ["Action Plan", "Stage", "Complete"],
  "outcome_verification": ["IsActionPlanEffective", "Complete", "Recurring Problem(s)"],
  "operational_context": ["Operating Centre", "Categories", "Action Types", "Past Due Status"]
}
```

### Level 1: Clean Categorical Dimensions (Direct Copilot Studio Implementation)

**1. Operating Centre** (Facility Dimension) - **PRIORITY 1**

- Values: `HUN`, `KWN`, `WDL`, `YRN`, `PNJ`
- **Copilot Studio Use**: Direct facility filtering in knowledge base searches
- **Implementation**: Create "Equipment_Incident_Lookup" tool with facility parameter
- **Question Potential**: High - "Show similar problems at Pinjarra facility"
- **Ground Truth**: Direct count queries

**2. Stage** (Workflow Progress) - **PRIORITY 1**

- Examples: "Action Plan Implemented - Actions Effective - Closed"
- **Copilot Studio Use**: Solution success filtering
- **Implementation**: "Solution_Success_Filter" tool for proven approaches
- **Question Potential**: High - "Show only completed solutions"
- **Ground Truth**: Status-based queries

**3. Past Due Status** - **PRIORITY 2**

- Values: "N/A", "Past Due", "Due Today"
- **Copilot Studio Use**: Urgency escalation triggers
- **Implementation**: Basic escalation logic for recurring patterns
- **Question Potential**: Medium - "Are there overdue similar issues?"
- **Ground Truth**: Status counting

**4. Action Types** - **PRIORITY 3**

- Values: "Reliability Action Request"
- **Copilot Studio Use**: Limited - appears uniform
- **Implementation**: Context filtering only
- **Question Potential**: Low - Appears uniform
- **Ground Truth**: Limited variation

### Level 2: Text Analysis Dimensions (Basic Pattern Matching for Copilot Studio)

**5. Title** (Equipment + Problem Description) - **PRIORITY 1**

- Examples:
  - "Unplanned maintenance on generator due to conveyor roller issues"
  - "electrical system failure in truck"
  - "Premature failure of seal in truck"

## Dimensional Question Generation Strategy

### Simple Questions (5/30) - Clean Categorical Only

- "How many incidents in [Operating Centre]?"
- "How many [Past Due Status] incidents?"
- "How many [Stage] action plans?"

### Intermediate Questions (7/30) - Cross-Dimensional + Text Extraction

- "How many [equipment type from Title] incidents in [Operating Centre]?"
- "What's the completion rate by [Operating Centre]?"
- "How many incidents in [year] by facility?"

### Hard Questions (18/30) - Complex Text Analysis + Multi-Dimensional

- "What's the success rate for [equipment type] issues in [facility] during [year]?"
- "What are the most common root cause categories for [equipment type]?"
- "Which facilities have the most effective solutions for [failure type]?"

## Required Pre-Processing for Ground Truth

### 1. Text Mining Pipeline

```python
# Extract equipment types from Title and "What happened?"
equipment_patterns = ["pump", "crusher", "conveyor", "truck", "generator", "motor"]
failure_patterns = ["electrical", "mechanical", "leak", "vibration", "failure"]
```

### 2. Categorical Value Discovery

```cypher
// Discover actual categorical values
MATCH (ar:ActionRequest)
RETURN DISTINCT ar.operating_centre as facilities
```

### 3. Text Classification for Semantic Dimensions

- Root cause categorization (design, maintenance, training, material)
- Action plan categorization (replace, inspect, monitor, standardize)
- Equipment type extraction (pump, crusher, conveyor, etc.)

## Recommended Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Level 1 (Clean Categorical)** - Generate 10 simple questions immediately
2. **Add Level 4 (Boolean/Status)** - Success rate and completion questions
3. **Implement Level 3 (Temporal)** - Year-based analysis questions
4. **Build Level 2 (Text Mining)** - Advanced semantic questions

This approach generates ground truth questions **based on actual data capabilities** rather than theoretical dimensional modeling.

## Integration with Existing Search Queries

The existing search queries in `graph_search_config.json` already demonstrate:

- Equipment pattern recognition: `toLower(ar.categories) CONTAINS toLower($search_term)`
- Cross-facility analysis: Facility + Equipment combinations
- Temporal filtering: `year(ar.initiation_date) = $year`
- Effectiveness tracking: `v.is_action_plan_effective = 'Yes'`

These existing patterns should drive the ground truth question structure.
