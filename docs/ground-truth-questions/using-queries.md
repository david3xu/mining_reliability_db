each field -> question, filter out, 




can you list all of the dimensiona you thinking can be extract from our data for dimentional modeling  ? output a md file . @/facility_data ?
what i can thinking, not all, these dimentions can be from possible text fields or other: 
equipment (asset), facility (location) , temporal, action plan, immeidate action, failure mode, root cause, recurring problem, etc 


thinking 


can you create 15 questions format template for the each level ? from 1 - 6 most dirmensions. including another table in @dimensions-table.md , thinking carefully, dont' duplicate , your questions should be from stakeholder (maintenance engineer ) who face new incident, and cant find help from history data
