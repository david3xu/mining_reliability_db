## Stakeholder Question Quality Framework

| Question Type | Engineer Need | Information Goal | Action Outcome |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| **"What should I do?"** | Immediate guidance | Action steps | Execute solution |
| **"What works?"** | Solution validation | Proven methods | Apply best practice |
| **"What should I watch for?"** | Risk awareness | Warning signs | Prevent escalation |
| **"Who can help?"** | Expert support | Knowledge sharing | Get assistance |
| **"How urgent is this?"** | Priority setting | Risk assessment | Resource allocation |

## Question Quality Criteria

### ❌ Poor (Statistical): 
"How many gearbox incidents occurred?"

### ✅ Good (Stakeholder): 
"What immediate actions should I take for gearbox failure?"

### ❌ Poor (Analytical): 
"What's the success rate for electrical repairs?"

### ✅ Good (Stakeholder): 
"Which electrical troubleshooting method works best?"

### ❌ Poor (Data-Driven): 
"How many pump failures per year?"

### ✅ Good (Stakeholder): 
"What warning signs indicate pump problems?"

## Implementation for Copilot Evaluation

Each question tests whether the AI copilot can:
1. **Provide actionable guidance** (not just data)
2. **Recommend specific solutions** (not just statistics)
3. **Identify relevant expertise** (not just counts)
4. **Assess situation urgency** (not just trends)
5. **Deliver contextual intelligence** (not just generic answers)

This approach ensures ground truth questions evaluate **problem-solving capability** rather than **data retrieval accuracy**.
