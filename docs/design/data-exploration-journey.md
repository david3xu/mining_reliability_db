# Mining Reliability Database: Data Exploration Journey

## The Raw Dataset

Starting with 41 fields from mining reliability records:

```
1. Action Request Number    15. What happened?               29. Response Revision Date
2. Title                    16. Requirement                  30. Did this action plan require...?
3. Initiation Date          17. Obj. Evidence                31. If yes, are there any corrective...
4. Action Types             18. Recom.Action                 32. Is Resp Satisfactory?
...
```

## Initial Observations

### Looking for Field Relationships

Examining these fields, I first notice several date fields that seem to follow a sequence:

```
Initiation Date → Due Date → Completion Date → Verification Date
```

This suggests some kind of process flow. Are these tracking the same thing at different points in time?

### Field Name Patterns

Looking at field names, I notice related terminology:
- Several fields contain "Action Request" or "Action Plan"
- Some relate to problems and causes
- Others seem to describe verification or review

These groupings hint at different aspects of what might be the same process.

### Testing a Working Theory

What if these fields are tracking an incident management process? If so, I would expect to see fields that:
- Describe an initial report
- Document what happened
- Identify why it happened
- Outline what was done about it
- Verify if the solution worked

Looking back at the fields, they do seem to align with these categories.

## Deeper Investigation

### Related Fields

When I group fields by similar focus:

```
Report-related: Action Request Number, Title, Initiation Date...
Problem-related: What happened?, Requirement...
Cause-related: Root Cause, Obj. Evidence...
Action-related: Action Plan, Due Date, Complete...
Verification-related: Effectiveness Verification Due Date, IsActionPlanEffective...
```

These groups appear to represent different aspects of the same workflow.

### Field Relationships in the Data

Looking at sample records, I notice patterns:
- Problem fields only have values when there's a corresponding report
- Action Plan fields only have values after a problem is documented
- Verification fields only have values after action plans exist

This suggests a dependency sequence in how the data is collected and used.

### Fields That Don't Fit the Sequence

Some fields don't seem to fit this workflow pattern:
- Department information (Init. Dept., Rec. Dept.)
- Asset details (Asset Number(s), Asset Activity numbers)
- Recurring problem indicators

These appear to be additional information rather than steps in the process.

### Multiple Values in Single Fields

Four fields consistently contain multiple values per record:
```
Obj. Evidence: often contains multiple points
Recom.Action: often lists several actions
Immd. Contain. Action: sometimes has multiple steps
Root Cause: sometimes identifies multiple factors
```

This suggests these fields are capturing collections of related information.

## Emerging Structure

As I continue examining the data, a structure begins to take shape:

1. A core process that follows the sequence:
   ```
   Initial Report → Problem Definition → Root Cause Analysis → Action Planning → Verification
   ```

2. Supporting information that attaches to different points in this process:
   - Departmental information connects to the initial report
   - Asset details relate to the problem
   - Review information connects to action plans

3. Some fields that contain multiple related values

## Evolving Data Model

This exploratory process suggests organizing the data into logical groups that reflect the natural workflow and relationships. A structure with approximately 10-15 distinct components would capture these groupings while maintaining their relationships.

The specific number and boundaries of these components would depend on analytical priorities and implementation considerations, but the core workflow structure and supporting information groups provide a natural framework for organizing the raw fields.
