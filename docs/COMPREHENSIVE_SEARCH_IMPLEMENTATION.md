# Comprehensive Search Implementation Summary

## Overview

The mining reliability database now features a **comprehensive search system** that combines ALL available search query types and templates into a single, unified search result. This ensures users get the most complete and relevant results possible for any search term.

## Combined Search Components

### 1. Query Templates (14 templates)

Located in `configs/queries/*.cypher`, these pre-built query templates address specific stakeholder questions:

- **why_did_this_happen.cypher** - Find root causes from similar symptoms
- **proven_solutions.cypher** - Find verified effective solutions
- **potential_root_causes.cypher** - Identify likely root causes
- **effective_actions.cypher** - Find actions that worked
- **who_can_help_me.cypher** - Find relevant experts and departments
- **how_do_i_fix_it.cypher** - Get repair guidance
- **what_should_i_check_first.cypher** - Get investigation priorities
- **diagnostic_experts.cypher** - Find diagnostic expertise
- **investigation_approaches.cypher** - Get investigation methods
- **repair_timelines.cypher** - Get repair time estimates
- **expert_departments.cypher** - Find departmental expertise
- **prioritized_investigation_steps.cypher** - Get step-by-step guidance
- **how_do_i_figure_out_whats_wrong.cypher** - Get diagnostic guidance
- **effective_actions_debug.cypher** - Debug version of effective actions

### 2. Configuration-Based Searches (7 categories)

Defined in `configs/graph_search_config.json`, these searches target specific analysis patterns:

- **direct_field_matches** - Exact matches in key fields with high precision
- **equipment_patterns** - Analyze equipment-specific failure patterns
- **causal_chains** - Trace root cause analysis pathways and solution chains
- **cross_facility_patterns** - Identify knowledge sharing opportunities
- **temporal_patterns** - Analyze time-based trends and seasonal patterns
- **recurring_sequences** - Identify repeat incidents and cyclical patterns
- **solution_effectiveness** - Find proven solutions with verification

### 3. Comprehensive Single Queries (3 queries)

Broad analysis queries for comprehensive incident and relationship analysis:

- **comprehensive_incident_search** - Broad incident pattern search
- **equipment_facility_network** - Equipment and facility relationship analysis
- **solution_effectiveness_graph** - Solution verification and effectiveness tracking

## Implementation Details

### Search Execution Flow

The comprehensive search follows a structured 4-phase approach:

#### Phase 1: Query Templates Execution

```python
# Execute ALL 14 query templates with filter replacement
filter_clause = f"""toLower(p.what_happened) CONTAINS toLower('{search_term}')
   OR toLower(ar.categories) CONTAINS toLower('{search_term}')
   OR toLower(rc.root_cause) CONTAINS toLower('{search_term}')
   OR toLower(ap.action_plan) CONTAINS toLower('{search_term}') """

# Priority templates executed first for better result ordering
for template_file in all_template_files:
    query = template_content.replace("{filter_clause}", filter_clause)
    results = execute_query(query)
```

#### Phase 2: Configuration Search Categories

```python
# Execute all query categories and their sub-queries
for category_key, category_config in search_categories:
    for query_key, query in category_config.items():
        results = execute_query(query, {"search_term": search_term})
```

#### Phase 3: Comprehensive Single Queries

```python
# Execute broad analysis queries
for comprehensive_query in comprehensive_queries:
    results = execute_query(query, {"search_term": search_term})
```

#### Phase 4: Result Processing

```python
# Remove duplicates based on incident IDs
unique_results = deduplicate_by_incident_id(all_results)

# Limit to top 100 for performance
limited_results = unique_results[:100]

# Create comprehensive summary with category breakdown
summary = create_summary(all_results, category_results, search_term)
```

### Result Structure

The comprehensive search returns a structured result with:

```python
{
    "nodes": [
        {
            "incident_id": "AR123",
            "search_category": "template_query",
            "query_template": "why_did_this_happen.cypher",
            "template_name": "Why Did This Happen",
            # ... other incident data
        },
        {
            "ar": {...},
            "search_category": "direct_field_matches",
            "search_subcategory": "incident_query",
            "category_description": "Direct field matches",
            # ... other incident data
        }
    ],
    "relationships": [],  # Currently empty, ready for future graph relationships
    "summary": "Found 45 results (42 unique) for 'motor' | Categories: Query Templates: 15, Direct field matches: 12, Equipment patterns: 8, Causal analysis: 7",
    "search_metadata": {
        "total_results": 45,
        "unique_results": 42,
        "displayed_results": 42,
        "categories": {
            "Query Templates": 15,
            "Direct field matches": 12,
            "Equipment patterns": 8,
            "Causal analysis": 7
        },
        "search_term": "motor"
    }
}
```

## API Usage

### Basic Comprehensive Search

```python
from dashboard.adapters import get_data_adapter

adapter = get_data_adapter()
results = adapter.execute_comprehensive_graph_search("motor")

print(results["summary"])
print(f"Total results: {len(results['nodes'])}")
```

### Organized Search by Category

```python
organized_results = adapter.execute_organized_comprehensive_search("motor")

# Access results by category
template_results = organized_results["template_queries"]
direct_matches = organized_results["direct_matches"]
equipment_patterns = organized_results["equipment_patterns"]
causal_analysis = organized_results["causal_analysis"]
```

## Key Features

### 1. Complete Coverage

- **24+ total search methods** combined into one result
- No query type or template is missed
- Comprehensive stakeholder question coverage

### 2. Intelligent Deduplication

- Removes duplicate incidents by action request number
- Preserves unique insights from different search methods
- Maintains result diversity

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Results limited to top 100 for UI performance
- Efficient query execution with error handling
- Priority template execution for better result ranking

### 4. Rich Metadata

- Detailed category breakdown in results
- Search statistics and result counts
- Source query identification for each result

### 5. Error Resilience

- Individual query failures don't stop the search
- Graceful fallbacks if configurations are missing
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Benefits

1. **Single Search Interface** - Users don't need to know which specific query to use
2. **Maximum Coverage** - Every search leverages all available search methods
3. **Stakeholder-Focused** - Combines technical analysis with business-relevant templates
4. **Future-Proof** - Easy to add new query templates or search categories
5. **Performance-Optimized** - Results are processed and limited appropriately

## Files Modified

- `dashboard/adapters/data_adapter.py` - Main comprehensive search implementation
- `configs/graph_search_config.json` - Configuration-based search definitions
- `configs/queries/*.cypher` - Query template definitions

The comprehensive search is now the default search method used throughout the application, ensuring every user query gets the most complete results possible.
