Agents depend on instructions to: Decide what tool or knowledge might need to be called to address a user query or autonomous trigger. Fill inputs for any tool based on the available context. Generate a response to the end user."*
>
> **Source**: `microsoft-copilot-studio (2)_part_12.md`

**Constraints**:
> *"The instructions can have up to 8,000 characters."*
>
> **Source**: `microsoft-copilot-studio (2)_part_12.md`

**Instructions Template**:
```bash
# Instructions Structure (8,000 char max)
INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE = "

"
```

**Example Implementation**:
```bash
# Mining Reliability Database Agent Instructions
MINING_INSTRUCTIONS = "
## Primary Goal
Provide stakeholder intelligence by analyzing mining reliability database containing 43+ historical maintenance fields including Action Types, Root Cause analysis, Asset Numbers, Action Plans, and Effectiveness Verification to support decision-making during new incidents with proven solutions and lessons learned from actual mining operations.

## Conversation Style
Professional and data-driven tone suitable for maintenance managers, operations teams, and reliability engineers. Provide structured responses with clear sections for Pattern Recognition, Solution Effectiveness, and Implementation Guidance based on historical evidence.

## Tool & Knowledge Selection Logic
- For incident queries: Use /ReliabilityDatabase filtering by 'Action Types' and 'Categories'
- For solution validation: Access /EffectivenessRecords filtering 'IsActionPlanEffective' = 'Yes'
- For pattern analysis: Search /RootCauseData using 'Root Cause' and 'Recurring Problem(s)' fields
- For asset management: Query /AssetRecords using 'Asset Number(s)' and equipment strategy fields
- For timeline planning: Analyze /ResponseData comparing 'Response Date' vs 'Due Date' patterns

## Response Guidelines
- Always include Action Request Number, Title, and Initiation Date for reference
- Format responses with clear headers: Problem Pattern, Historical Solutions, Implementation Timeline
- Include 'Amount of Loss' and 'Effectiveness Verification' data for business impact context
- Reference specific 'Operating Centre' and 'Stage' for location-relevant insights
- Escalate to maintenance manager when 'Recurring Problem(s)' = 'Yes' and no effective solutions found

## Boundaries & Limitations
- Cannot access real-time equipment sensors (use current monitoring systems)
- Cannot approve action plans (redirect to responsible department per 'Init. Dept.' and 'Rec. Dept.')
- Cannot override equipment management strategy (escalate per APSS documentation requirements)

> **Source**: `microsoft-copilot-studio (2)_part_12.md`

### 5.4 Knowledge Sources Integration

**Microsoft's Knowledge Framework**:
> *"After you add one of the following knowledge source types, you're required to provide a name and description. The knowledge name for each source should be unique. The description should be as detailed as possible, especially if generative AI is enabled, as the description aids generative orchestration."*
>
> **Source**: `microsoft-copilot-studio (2)_part_24.md`

**Knowledge Source Search Methods & Priorities**:

**Microsoft's Search Mode Differences**:
> *"How knowledge sources are searched depends on which orchestration mode the agent uses: classic or generative."*
>
> **Source**: `microsoft-copilot-studio (2)_part_24.md`

**Generative Orchestration Search Logic**:
> *"When an agent is configured to use generative orchestration, the following applies: Copilot Studio filters the knowledge sources using an internal GPT based on the description given to the knowledge source. All files uploaded to the agent are searched. For all other knowledge sources, Copilot Studio selects the top four knowledge sources, regardless of type. Those four knowledge sources are searched, in addition to all of the uploaded files."*
>
> **Source**: `microsoft-copilot-studio (2)_part_24.md`

**Classic Orchestration Limits**:
> *"When an agent is configured to use classic orchestration, the following applies: In the Conversational boosting system topic, the number of knowledge sources the agent can search is limited, and depends on the type of knowledge source."*

| Knowledge Source Type | Classic Mode Limit | Generative Mode Priority |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Uploaded Files** | Unlimited | **Always searched** (highest priority) |
| **SharePoint URLs** | 4 maximum | Selected from top 4 sources |
| **Dataverse Tables** | 2 sources (15 tables each) | Selected from top 4 sources |
| **Website URLs** | 4 maximum | Selected from top 4 sources |
| **Azure OpenAI Service** | 5 maximum | Selected from top 4 sources |
| **Real-time Connectors** | Varies by connector | Selected from top 4 sources |

### 5.13 Performance Monitoring & Analytics

**Microsoft's Analytics Framework**:
> *"The Analytics page in Copilot Studio provides an aggregated insight into the overall health of your agent with event triggers across analytics sessions."*
>
> **Source**: `microsoft-copilot-studio (2)_part_96.md`

**Key Metrics to Monitor**:
```bash
# Performance Indicators
ANALYTICS_METRICS = [
  "Knowledge source usage → Content effectiveness",
  "Action completion rates → Tool reliability",
  "User satisfaction scores → Response quality", 
  "Error rates → System stability",
  "Session duration → User engagement"
]
```
