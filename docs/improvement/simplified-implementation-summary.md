## Technical Architecture

### **Simplified Data Flow Pattern**
```
Clean JSON Data → Single-Value Extraction → Causal Intelligence Enhancement → Dynamic Entity Creation → Operational Analytics
```

### **Root Cause Intelligence Enhancement**
```python
# Input: "Equipment failure; Poor maintenance; Design flaw"
# Processing:
primary_cause = "Equipment failure; Poor maintenance; Design flaw"  # Complete original
secondary_cause = "Design flaw"  # Extracted tail for analytical depth

# Analytical Capability:
- Compare primary vs secondary cause patterns
- Track tail cause effectiveness across facilities  
- Identify systematic secondary factors
- Enable dual-dimension causal queries
```

### **Dynamic Labeling Strategy**
```cypher
# Traditional static labeling:
(:ActionRequest {title: "Motor Failure"})

# Enhanced field-driven labeling:
(:ActionRequest:Motor_Failure {title: "Motor Failure"})
// Enables direct categorical queries: MATCH (:Motor_Failure)
```
