- [ ] Missing data indicators track collection gaps
- [ ] Temporal sequences maintain progression relationships
- [ ] Cross-field context preserved through explicit connections

### **Dynamic Labeling Validation**
- [ ] Primary field values become node labels when available
- [ ] Cascade strategy falls back to secondary fields appropriately  
- [ ] Empty/missing priority fields skip to next available option
- [ ] Entity type used as final fallback for labeling

### **Query Capability Testing**
- [ ] Field-specific analytics return expected results
- [ ] Categorical cross-analysis functions properly
- [ ] Temporal pattern analysis detects progression sequences
- [ ] Missing data quality reports identify systematic gaps

### **Performance Verification**
- [ ] Large dataset transformation completes without memory issues
- [ ] Field entity creation scales appropriately with record volume
- [ ] Relationship creation maintains reasonable performance
- [ ] Query response times remain acceptable with increased entity density

## Business Impact Validation

## Strategic Outcome

This field-driven implementation transforms the Mining Reliability Database from **simplified entity storage** into **comprehensive knowledge representation** that preserves operational complexity while enabling systematic insight extraction across all analytical dimensions.

Engineering teams gain access to complete incident information rather than compressed abstractions, enabling mining operations to ask natural business questions and receive immediate analytical insights from their reliability data.

The system now reflects the true complexity of mining incident management while providing systematic capabilities for pattern discovery, effectiveness measurement, and operational optimization across all facility workflows.
